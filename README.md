# BaseBot_Obstacle_Course


Course Description and Obstacle Details
---
The obstacle course is supposed to test the BaseBotâ€™s ability to navigate through differnt challenges and a test of our group's ability to code and program the bot accordingly. 

The course is made up of:
-  3d-printed train tracks
-  3d-printed flowers
-  Wooden ramp
-  Cardboard rough terrain
-  Cardboard pathway

BaseBot Interaction with Each Obstacle

1. A section where the BaseBot must travel in a straight line, going over the rough terrain.
2. The bot must stop, position itself correctly and then go up the ramp without going off the sides.
3. The BaseBot then must turn and stay on the pathway.
4. Then the bo0t has to go either between the flowers or drive over them.
5. Finally the bot goes on the train tracks and exits the course.

How to Run the Python Script

1. Open VEX Exp and start making the code to make the robot run 
2. Connect the BasebBot Brain via USB to a computer
3. Connect the brain and devices such as the drivetrain
4. Then download your code onto the brain of the robot and run the code
5. If the code works then your finished, if not redo all the steps!

Reflection

What Worked Well
- The BaseBot handled the rough terrain pretty well
- Going over over the flowers was easy
- The train tracks also didn't become a problem.
- The code also ran pretty smoothly and wasn't super duper complicated to figure out 

Challenges Faced
- Obstacles would become unstuck when the bot drove over them, while trying to run code group memebers had to hold down parts of the course in order to test.
- Making the bot go left and right on the pathway was a hard task to do
- Bot was having a hard time trying to go on the ramp as the wheels weren't big enough
